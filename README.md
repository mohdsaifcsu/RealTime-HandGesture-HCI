# Real-time Hand Gesture-Based HCI System

This is a real-time **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** project that enables users to control **system volume** and **screen brightness** using **hand gestures** captured via webcam. The system uses fingertip tracking and gesture recognition to create a contactless interface.

Engineered using **Python**, **OpenCV**, **MediaPipe**, and Windows APIs (`pycaw` for volume and `wmi` for brightness), this application enhances accessibility and user interaction with intuitive, real-time visual feedback.

##  Features

-  Real-time hand detection and tracking using **MediaPipe**
- ✋ Finger state recognition (e.g., thumb–index distance)
- 🔊 Volume control via hand gesture (with safety trigger: pinky down)
- 💡 Screen brightness control via hand gesture
-  On-screen visual feedback and FPS display
-  Modular design with a reusable hand tracking module

##  Install Dependencies

Install all required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Or install manually:
pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy pycaw wmi comtypes



##  How to Run

###  Volume Control
```bash
python VolumeHandControl.py

## Brightness Control
```bash
python GestureBrightnessControl.py

🖐️ Use a pinch gesture (thumb + index finger) to adjust settings.
 Setting is only applied when pinky is down (gesture safety mechanism).
